# Machine Learning Decision Support System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning–based decision support system capable of ingesting structured (tabular) datasets. The system automates data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and generates data-driven decisions based on the learned patterns.

The framework is designed to be reusable and adaptable across different problem domains, making it suitable for real-world decision-making scenarios rather than being limited to a single dataset.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a flexible machine learning pipeline that supports diverse structured datasets  
- Automate data preprocessing and feature handling  
- Perform exploratory data analysis to extract meaningful insights  
- Train and evaluate predictive models  
- Generate final decisions or recommendations based on model outputs
